Games are often characterized by their tools and rules. While rules are subject to variations and changes, enough 
change in the rules usually results in a "new" game. For instance, baseball can be played with "real" 
baseballs or with wiffleballs. However, if the players decide to play with only three bases, they are arguably 
playing a different game. There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of 
their own rules, but even then there are often immutable meta-rules.Rules generally determine the time-keeping system, the rights 
and responsibilities of the players, scoring techniques, preset boundaries, and each player's goals.The rules of a game may 
be distinguished from its aims. For most competitive games, the ultimate aim is winning: in this sense, checkmate 
is the aim of chess. Common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points 
or tokens (as in Settlers of Catan), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the 
game (as in Monopoly), or some relationship of one's game tokens to those of one's opponent (as in 
chess's checkmate). There may also be intermediate aims, which are tasks that move a player toward winning. For 
instance, an intermediate aim in football is to score goals, because scoring goals will increase one's likelihood of 
winning the game, but isn't alone sufficient to win the game.An aim identifies a Sufficient Condition for successful 
action, whereas the rule identifies a necessary condition for permissible action.[17] For example, the aim of chess is 
to checkmate, but although it is expected that players will try to checkmate each other, it is not 
a rule of chess that a player must checkmate the other player whenever possible. Similarly, it is not 
a rule of football that a player must score a goal on a penalty; while it is expected 
the player will try, it is not required. While meeting the aims often requires a certain degree of
